This project contains the study of two systems, a double pendulum and orbiting planets. 

One will find 'DoublePendulumLeoDeer.ipynb' which contains code to simulate a double pendulum as well as further studies into the underlying physics of the system and 'OrbitsLeoDeer.ipynb' which simulates both 2 and 3 orbiting bodies under the influence of gravity.
